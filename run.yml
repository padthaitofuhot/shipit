# Docker run overrides
#
# You can override anything you see in the "run:" tree in box/box.yml here!
# Normally you don't want to do this, but sometimes it's helpful, such as
# when you'd like to map a service to a different host port.
# Example:
# ports: "-p 0.0.0.0:80:80/tcp -p 0.0.0.0:80:80/udp"
