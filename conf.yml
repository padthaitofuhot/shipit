# Configuration overrides
#
# You can override anything you see in the "conf:" tree in box/box.yml here!
# Additionally, there are a few properties you can set here that do not have
# defaults in box.yml that you may find useful.
#
# APK REPOS
# Uncomment to use your favorite APK mirror
# Only add the URL pointing the mirror root, everything else is added automatically!
# For example, if you set the following:
# alpine_mirror: http://192.168.1.2/alpine
# it will resolve to:
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/v3.3/{main,community}
# -AND-
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/edge/{main,community,testing}
